The OpenChain Project helps to identify and share the core components of a high quality Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) compliance program. OpenChain builds trust in Open Source by making things simpler, more efficient and more consistent. It is the industry-standard for managing Open Source compliance across the supply chain.

The OpenChain Specification defines a core set of requirements a FOSS compliance program should meet. This creates trust that an organization provides the artifacts required for FOSS license compliance in software it shares with others. Compliance artifacts consist of: source code, build scripts, license copies, attribution notices, modification notices and other materials open source licenses governing a software deliverable may require.
