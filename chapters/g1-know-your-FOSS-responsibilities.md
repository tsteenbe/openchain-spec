# Requirements

## G1: Know Your FOSS Responsibilities

**1.1** **A written FOSS policy exists that governs FOSS license compliance of the Supplied Software distribution where, as a minimum, it must be internally communicated.**

**Verification Artifact(s):**

☐ 1.1.1 A documented FOSS policy exists.

☐ 1.1.2 A documented procedure exists that makes all Software Staff aware of the existence of
the FOSS policy (e.g., via training, internal wiki, or other practical communication method).

**Rationale:**

Ensure steps were taken to create, record and make Software Staff aware of the existence of a FOSS policy. Although no requirements are provided here on what should be included in the policy, other requirements in other sections may.

**1.2** **Mandatory FOSS training for all Software Staff exists such that:**

* **The training, as a minimum, covers the following topics:**
    * **The FOSS policy and where to find a copy;**
    * **Basics of IP law pertaining to FOSS and FOSS licenses;**
    * **FOSS licensing concepts (including the concepts of permissive and copyleft licenses);**
    * **FOSS project licensing models;**
    * **Software Staff roles and responsibilities pertaining to FOSS compliance specifically and
    the FOSS policy in general; and**
    * **Process for identifying, recording and/or tracking of FOSS components contained in Supplied Software.**
* **Software Staff must have completed FOSS training within the last 24 months (to be
considered current). A test may be used to allow Software Staff to satisfy the training requirement.**

**Verification Artifact(s):**

☐ 1.2.1 FOSS course materials covering the above topics exists (e.g., slide decks, online course,
or other training materials).

☐ 1.2.2 Method of tracking the completion of the course for all Software Staff.

☐ 1.2.3 At least 85% of all Software Staff are current, as per definition in above section.

**Rationale:**

Ensure the Software Staff have recently attended FOSS training and that a core set of relevant FOSS topics are covered. The intent is to ensure a core base level set of topics are covered but a typical training program would likely be more comprehensive than what is required here.
