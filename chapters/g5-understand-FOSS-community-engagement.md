## G5: Understand FOSS Community Engagement

**5.1** **A written policy exists that governs contributions to publicly accessible FOSS projects by employees on behalf of the organization where, as a minimum, it must be internally communicated.**

**Verification Artifact(s):**

☐ 5.1.1 A documented FOSS contribution policy exists;

☐ 5.1.2 A documented procedure exists that makes all Software Staff aware of the existence of the FOSS contribution policy (e.g., via training, internal wiki, or other practical communication method).

**Rationale:**

Ensure an organization has given reasonable consideration to developing a policy with respect to publicly contributing to FOSS. The FOSS contribution policy can be made a part of the overall FOSS policy of an organization or be its own separate policy. In the situation where contributions are not permitted at all, a policy should exist making that position clear.

**5.2** **Provided the FOSS contribution policy permits such contributions, a process exists for confirming contributions adhere to the FOSS contribution policy, which might include (but is not limited to) the following considerations:**

* **legal approval for license considerations**
* **business rationale or approval**
* **technical review of code to be contributed**
* **community engagement and interaction, including a project’s Code of Conduct or equivalent**
* **adherence to project-specific contribution requirements**

**Verification Artifact(s):**

☐ 5.2.1 Provided the FOSS contribution policy permits contributions, a documented procedure exists that describes the FOSS contribution process.

**Rationale:**

Ensure an organization has a documented process for how the organization publicly contributes FOSS. A policy may exist such that contributions are not permitted at all. In that specific situation it is understood that no process may exist and this requirement would nevertheless be met.
