## G6: Certify Adherence to OpenChain Requirements

**6.1** **In order for an organization to be OpenChain certified, it must affirm that it has a FOSS program that meets the criteria described in this OpenChain Conformance Specification version 1.0.**

**Verification Artifact(s):**

‚òê 6.1.1 The organization affirms that a program exists that meets all the requirements of this OpenChain Conformance Specification version 1.0.

**Rationale:**

To ensure that if an organization declares that it has a program that is OpenChain Conforming, that such program has met all the requirements of this specification. The mere meeting of a subset of these requirements would not be considered sufficient to warrant a program be OpenChain certified.
