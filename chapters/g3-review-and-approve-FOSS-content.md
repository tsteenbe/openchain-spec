## G3: Review and Approve FOSS Content

**3.1** **A process exists for identifying, tracking and archiving a list of all FOSS components (and their respective Identified Licenses) from which Supplied Software is comprised.**

**Verification Artifact(s):**

☐ 3.1.1 A documented procedure exists used to identify, track, and archive a list of FOSS components and their Identified Licenses from which the Supplied Software is comprised.

**Rationale:**

To ensure a process exists for identifying and listing all FOSS components used to construct the Supplied Software. This inventory must exist to support the systematic review of each component’s license terms to understand their respective distribution obligations and restrictions applicable to the Supplied Software. The recorded inventory also serves as evidence that the process was followed.

**3.2** **The FOSS program must be capable of handling typical FOSS use cases encountered by Software Staff for Supplied Software, which may include the following use cases - when parts of the Supplied Software (note that the below list is neither exhaustive, nor may all of the below use cases apply depending on the organization):**

* **are distributed in binary form**
* **are distributed in source form**
* **are integrated with other FOSS such that it may trigger copyleft obligations**
* **contains modified FOSS**
* **contains FOSS or other software under an incompatible license interacting with other components within the Supplied Software**
* **contains FOSS with attribution requirements**

**Verification Artifact(s):**

☐ 3.2.1 A process has been implemented that is capable of addressing the typical FOSS use
cases encountered by Software Staff for Supplied Software.

**Rationale:**

To cause the FOSS program to be sufficiently robust to address that organization’s typical use
cases as a result of that organization’s business practices.
