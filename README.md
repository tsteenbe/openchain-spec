# The OpenChain â€‹Specification

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tsteenbe/openchain-spec.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tsteenbe/openchain-spec)

The OpenChain Project helps to identify and share the core components of a high quality Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) compliance program. OpenChain builds trust in Open Source by making things simpler, more efficient and more consistent. It is the industry-standard for managing Open Source compliance across the supply chain.

The OpenChain Specification defines a core set of requirements a FOSS compliance program should meet. This creates trust that an organization provides the artifacts required for FOSS license compliance in software it shares with others. Compliance artifacts consist of: source code, build scripts, license copies, attribution notices, modification notices and other materials open source licenses governing a software deliverable may require.

This repository holds under active development version of the specification as:

* [MarkDown](https://github.com/tsteenbe/openchain-spec/tree/master/chapters) (master branch)
* [HTML](https://tsteenbe.github.io/openchain-spec/) (gh-pages branch, build on every commit to master branch)

For additional information please also see the [OpenChain project website](https://www.openchainproject.org/).
